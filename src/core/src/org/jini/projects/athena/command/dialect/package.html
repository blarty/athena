  Package containing the <CODE>DialectEngine</CODE> class as well as any implementing Dialects.<br/>
  Dialects are the way in which a <code>Call</code> is processed, Calls, supplied with an appropriate command, will request a
  dialect from the <code>DialectEngine</code> class  for the given <code>Command</code>s callname. A dialect will process the internal arguments, at which point
the Call object will execute the invocation against the host, the dialect will then process the output of the cal accordingly and finally pass that data back to the call, which
    returns any data back to the client.
