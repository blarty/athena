	Contains a standard client for Athena that will load up an XML file such as the one below, and will execute the commands against Athena.
	<b>Note:</b> This currently only supports string parameters, which works for all athena handlers that use SQL replacement, 
	but may pose problems for Stored Procedures - this client will be anhanced in the next version.
