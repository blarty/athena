<p><h1>Athena Transaction Framework</h1></p><br/><br/>
<p>Athena provides a bridge between Jini transactions and existing transactional systems. It enables datasources to manage their own transactions as normal,
also enables them to participate within a larger distributed transaction.</p>
<p>Athena currently supports JDBC databases at a fairly generic level, but supports more advanced features such as Stored Procedures, CLOBS, SQL STRUCTs and ARRAYs,
however support for this features is very vendor specific. Recently support for embedded databases was added, specifically HSQLDB</p>
<p>In addition, to JDBC systems, Athena also supports communication and transaction bridging to CICS through either BEA Jolt/Tuxedo or IBM CICS Transaction Gateway</p>
