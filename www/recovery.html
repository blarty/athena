    <h2>Recovery</h2>
In the main, because Athena 'proxies' an existing transactional system, upon restart, it checks with the Transaction Manager, 
through the normal transaction join protocol, and also checks with the transaction manager regarding the state of the transaction<br/><br/>

If, the transaction manager notes an ABORTED transaction, Athena simply dumps it's logs and continues restart. 
If it is signalled to be committed, Athena reissues the updates to the host system, and considers the matter closed, as
these updates would have gone through normally.<br/>If Athena signalled PREPARE to the Transaction Manager, of course there
is the issue that if Athena is offline for long enough then these re-issued updates may not succeed, Athena the stores this log to disk
and raises an appropriate error message. Athena can be configured to either exit at this point, i.e. will not allow further connections until this
issue is resolved in some way, or you may wish it to continue normally, and resolve the issue without affecting anything else.<br/>

<br/>
<h3>What does Athena store in it's logs?</h3>
Athena stores each command as each executeUpdate occurs. For this reason, it is important to have
no time sensitive transformations that may adversely affect your systems, should they be re-issued later on.<br/>
<b>Why re-translate?</b><br/>
In the event of a failure-recovery scenario, Athena assumes that the transaction was aborted anyway, therefore, by using
deterministic translations, if the transaction recovers and resubmits the commands against the host, the 
data should be the same, BUT if you have translations based on when the update occurs, these will now be dependent on when
the <i>recovery</i> occurs, not when the command was <i>received</i>from the client.<br/>
If you need time information such as a date, supply the date as a field, and translate the field in an Athena type. In fact, Athena forces this because it has no internal concept
of 'NOW' or 'TODAY
